# Minesweeper GameðŸ’£






## Overview

Welcome to Minesweeper! This is a classic game where the player has to clear a minefield without detonating any mines.

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game where the player uncovers tiles on a grid. Each tile may contain either a mine or a number indicating the number of mines in the adjacent tiles. The objective is to uncover all tiles that do not contain mines.

A Demo of the Minesweeper project is shown below for proper understanding.

## Usage

1. **Setup:**  Click on a tile to start the game.
2. **Gameplay:** Left-click to reveal a tile. Right-click to flag a tile as a mine. 
3. **Winning:** Clear all non-mine tiles without detonating any mines to win the game.
4. **Losing:** Accidentally clicking on a mine tile ends the game.
## Project Stages

We can break down the project in the following stages:

1. UI part with HTML and CSS
    - Create the UI of project as shown in the video.
2. Javascript Functionalities
    - Add Event Listner
    - Random bomb placing
    - Random number placing
## Features

- Customizable grid size and mine count.
- Enhance the Minesweeper game by displaying numbers around the   clicked square, indicating the likelihood of nearby bombs. These numbers represent the count of bombs adjacent to the clicked box, providing players with valuable information to strategically navigate the minefield.
- Flagging tiles to mark potential mines.
- Revealing all non-mine tiles to win the game.


## Technologies Used
1. HTML:
Used for structuring. Started by creating the basic structure of the Minesweeper grid using HTML wherein each cell can be represented by a <div> element.

2. CSS :
Used CSS to style the grid and make it visually appealing.Added different colors for mines, numbers, and empty cells to make the game more user-friendly.

3. JavaScript:
This is where the real magic happens. Written the JavaScript code to handle the game logic.Used functions to generate the Minesweeper grid, placed mines randomly, calculated the number of mines around each cell, handled user clicks, and revealed cells.

5. VS Code Editor:
All of the above.
The structuring part done in the HTML.
The Styling and layout part in the CSS.
THe logics and functions part performed in the JavaScript.
All of this are performed in the VS Code Editor. Basically it is a versatile, lightweight and free-source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
## Difficulties Faced

In the development of the Minesweeper project, I encountered several challenges:

- Algorithm Complexity: Designing and implementing the algorithm to calculate the number of adjacent bombs for each square while ensuring efficiency and accuracy posed a significant challenge. Balancing performance with accuracy was crucial for providing a smooth gaming experience.

- User Interface Design: Creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that effectively communicates game mechanics and feedback to the player required careful planning and iteration. Ensuring compatibility across various screen sizes and devices added complexity to the UI design process.

- Game Logic and Rules: Implementing and enforcing the rules of Minesweeper, such as ensuring that clicking on a mine results in game over while revealing nearby squares without bombs, demanded meticulous attention to detail. Handling edge cases and boundary conditions added an extra layer of complexity to the game logic.

- Testing and Debugging: Thoroughly testing the game to identify and address bugs, edge cases, and usability issues was a continuous effort throughout the development process. Testing various scenarios and user interactions helped ensure the stability and reliability of the game.

- Cross-browser Compatibility: Ensuring compatibility across different web browsers and platforms presented challenges due to variations in browser behavior and support for web technologies. Testing and debugging across multiple browsers helped mitigate compatibility issues.

## Conclusion

Embarking on the journey of crafting a game i.e., Minesweeper using HTML, CSS and JavaScript has been an invaluable experience, significantly elevating my proficiency in web development. Confronting challenges such as debugging code issues and navigating design decisions has been instrumental in fostering my overall growth.

Throughout this journey, my command of HTML, CSS and JavaScript has matured, fostering a greater ease in organizing code and leveraging advanced features like Flexbox and Grid layout for enhanced styling and responsiveness.

While I take pride in my accomplishments, I am mindful of areas for further enhancement. Future development projects will see me exploring advanced CSS animations and coding into JavaScript for interactive elements. This enthusiasm for continuous learning propels me towards expanding my skill set and actively participating in coding communities to foster connections with fellow developers.

In conclusion, my Minesweeper project aims to deliver an engaging and challenging gaming experience. By incorporating features such as customizable grid size and the display of numbers indicating nearby bombs, players can enjoy a classic game with modern enhancements. Whether you're a Minesweeper enthusiast or new to the game, we believe our project offers an enjoyable and strategic experience for all players. We welcome contributions, feedback, and suggestions to further improve and refine the Minesweeper game.
